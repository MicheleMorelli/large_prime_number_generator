# Generator of Large Prime Numbers
-Work in Progress-

I wanted to create a fast generator of large prime numbers based on my small variation of Erthosthene's Sieve. On a 8GB machine it currently throws a segmentation fault error beyond 4099999 - definitely needs some memory management improvements...
